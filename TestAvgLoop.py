# This program calculates the average of multiple test scores entered by the user.
# Change Log:
# 09/20/2024 - Created a program that calculates the average of 3 test scores.
# 10/27/2024 - Modified the program to allow any number of test scores, added input validation, and used loops.

# Display a welcome message to the user
print("Welcome to the test average calculator!!!\n")
print("You can enter as many test scores as you want.")
print("Enter '999' to finish entering scores.\n")

# Initialize variables

    if test_input.isnumeric():
        test_score = int(test_input)
